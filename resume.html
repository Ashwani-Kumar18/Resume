        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>As a recent graduate in Computer Science, I am excited to embark on my professional journey through an
            internship in the IT industry. With a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and
            C++, along with proficiency in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am eager to
            apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world projects.
            What distinguishes me is my proactive approach to learning and problem-solving. I thrive in environments
            that challenge me to think critically and creatively, as evidenced by my academic coursework and hands-on
            projects. I am committed to delivering high-quality results, with a keen eye for detail and a drive for
            continuous improvement.
            Outside of academics, I am an avid learner who actively seeks out opportunities to explore the latest trends
            in technology. Driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to make a positive impact, I am enthusiastic
            about the opportunity to contribute to the success of your organization as an intern.</p>
